### What is expected to learn from data Structures
* Logical View
* Operations
* Cost of operations
* Implementation
* Applications


### Arrays
    * Contiguous area of memory.
    * Constant time access to any element.
    * Constant time to add/remove at the end.
    * Linear time to add/remove at an arbitary location.
    * In all the languages, arrays are implemented. Yes, even in python.
    * In terms of memory, As the size of arrays increases, they are not very efficent as it has to grab a contiguous memeory.

#### Dynamic Arrays
    * We can extend the array size in case of dynamic arrays. This can be implemeneted by adding few more opeartions to Static array 
    * Not so memory friendly.
    * Adding and removing elements in arbitary locations is costly operations.
    * In Java, these are implemeneted using "ArrayList"

**Note:** In Python, lists can hold any type of data and these are dynamic.
     

### Single Linked List
    * Non-contiguous memory is allocated for linked lists elements.
    * There will be two parts in each element of LL. One store the data and another to store the location of next element.
    * Linear time in accessing element.
    * Constant time to add/remove element at the beginning of LL and linear time at the end of the LL(If tail pointer is not given defined).
    * Linear time to add/remove at an arbitary location.
    * In terms of memory, As the size of LL increases, they are very useful, as the elements require minimal memory and are Non-contiguous.
